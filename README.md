Hello!
I decided to fetch data from API to redux store and use it in my app from there.
For handling search I used react-hook-form and included simple validation using only react-hook-form API and validator package.
Search history is persisted between reloads - I used redux persist and session storage.
API key is in the .env file. If application will exhaust requests limit it will inform You about that.

Happy testing!

## Live demo

Demeo is avaliable here:(http://check-that-ip.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation

I used yarn during the development process, to run this application locally use:

### `yarn`

### `yarn start`
